        <p>I became interested in web development because I initially aspired to be a UX Designer. My curiosity about how websites are designed and brought 
          to life led me to explore the development side of things. Understanding both design and functionality gives me a deeper appreciation for how user 
          experiences are created and optimized on the web.</p>
